Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 2025

1. Introduction

Welcome to Face Crush (the "Game"). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you play our game. We built Face Crush to be a simple, fun puzzle game. Please read this policy to understand your privacy when using our services.

2. Data We Collect and Use

• Gameplay: The Game runs on your device. Game state (score, level, combo, best score, mute preference) is kept in memory or stored only on your device. We do not receive or store this data on our servers.
• No account: We do not require sign-in or registration. We do not collect your name, email, or other account data for gameplay.

3. Third-Party Advertising

The Game may show ads provided by Google (AdMob). Google’s advertising SDK may collect or receive device identifiers and usage data to deliver and measure ads. This may include:
• Advertising ID (e.g. IDFA on iOS) for ad personalization, when you have consented via your device or app settings.
• General device or app usage data for ad delivery and measurement.

Google’s use of data is governed by their privacy policy. We do not control what Google collects. You can learn more and manage ad preferences at:
• Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
• Google Ads: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

We require that any third party that receives data through our app (including Google) provides the same or equal protection of user data as described in this policy and as required by applicable guidelines and law.

4. Other Third Parties

• App stores (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play) or web hosting providers may collect standard technical data (such as IP address or device type) as part of their own services. We do not receive, use, or control that data for the Game.
• If you contact us for support (e.g., by email), we will use the contact details you provide only to respond. We do not use them for marketing unless you agree.

5. Data Retention and Your Choices

• On-device data (scores, settings) remains on your device until you delete the app or clear app data.
• To stop ad-related data collection you can: reset your device’s advertising identifier (in system settings), and/or delete the app.
• To request deletion of any data you have sent us (e.g. via support email), contact us at the email below. We will process requests in line with applicable law.

6. Children's Privacy

The Game is suitable for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has shared personal information with us, please contact us and we will address it.

7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and change the "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Game after changes means you accept the updated policy.
